  <h2>Lets Collaborate!</h2>
<div style="color: green; background-color: black; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace;">
  <p><strong>The Bangor Makerspace community is skilled, 
  experienced, and endlessly creative.</strong><br>
  We’re always seeking projects that serve the 
  Greater Bangor area - and new ideas that challenge us.</p>

  <p>While the best way to connect is through our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UZkcecgRch">Discord server</a>, 
  you’re also welcome to reach out via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebangormakerspace">Facebook</a>, 
  email us at <strong>contact@bangormakerspace.org</strong>, 
  or stop by one of our regular events.</p>

  <p>We host <strong>weekly build nights</strong> where the public is 
  invited to bring a project, get hands-on help, 
  use our tools and equipment, and discover 
  what the Makerspace has to offer.</p>

  <p><strong>Collaboration is at the heart of what we do.</strong><br>
  That can mean different things to different people.
  From appearing or hosting at community events, 
  to providing workshops or public talks that inspire creativity.</p>

  <p>We also maintain a network of skilled members and may be able to 
  connect you with the right person to help bring your project to life.
  In select cases, the Makerspace may even contract for 
  <strong>research, development, or prototype work</strong> 
  on specialized or confidential technologies.</p>
